# My Notes

I am creating this repo to keep track of all my notes of various subjects, I want to keep it public incase anyone I know needs notes. Or the off chance someone randomly comes across it and finds it as a good reading resource.

I will try to keep it as orgianized as possible but theres no promise to that...

These will more than likely be just topics about Computer science, networking, mindset, and programming in general. Just thought it would be nice to have a public note database somewhere to be able to reference at any time almost.
