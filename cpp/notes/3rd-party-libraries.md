# 3rd Party Libraries

These libraries are created from other people or companies that had a problem and created a solution that you can use in your own code. A example where you might need one is if you are developing a game. A third party library for a game engine would save you hundreds or thousands of hours of coding since their game engine is available to use. Since sometimes its better not reinvent the wheel, it helps in the beginning to work with 3rd party libraries
