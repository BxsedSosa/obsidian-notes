# The Standard Library

C++ like many of languages comes with pre-packaged libraries that are installed when you install the language. These are usually called `Standard Libraries`. These are useful libraries of code that's been already written so you don't have to come up with your own solution just need to understand how the person who wrote that code wanted that function to be used. One common library is `iostream` which is used for **Input/Output** so you can take input from user that's using your program or you can output to the user information that was gathered.

Almost all C++ programs use standard library one way or another. Most C++ linkers are automatically linked to the standard library by default.
