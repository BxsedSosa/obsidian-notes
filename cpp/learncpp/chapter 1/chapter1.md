## Statements

In programming a statement is a type of instructions that the program has to preform.

Statement are a very common instruction in C++ so seeing them and understanding what they are and what they look like is a good idea. They are the smallest independent unit of computation in C++. Think of a statement as a complete sentence in English but each statement in coding you are asking for the computer to do something in deep detail. Most (but not all) statements in C++ are ended with a semicolon `;`. Here are the different types of C++ [[Statements]]:

- Declaration statements
- Jump statements
- Expression statement
- Compound statement
- Selection statement
- Iteration statement
- Try block statement


## Functions and the `main` Function

A collection of statements put together in one block of code could be called a `function`. A `function` being a collection of statements, each statement within the function is completed from top to bottom/sequentially.

**Rule**
One rule within C++, it is a requirement to have a function called `main` that puts everything all together for the compiler to put everything you needed together.

When running a program that was compiled, starting from top going to the bottom. It runs every line of code, but if there were to be any errors that could cause the program to abort and end early. This is when you would have to try and debug what the issue is in this case.

The name of a function i.e. `main` is called its `identifier`.
