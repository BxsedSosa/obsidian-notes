# Quant Dev

## Why?

Why do I want to become a Quant developer...? Since I been on my self journey for learning coding I struggled with idenity of what field of work I wanted to be profiecent in. I've been game dev, web dev (front and backend), devops, & embedded. I delved into web dev the most out of all of these but I would try my hardest to stay with it and some how lose motivation at some points. I found quant maybe like a year or 2 ago, and thought to myself this sounds really interesting. I've always been interested in stock trading and did want to become a day trader a while ago but I thought it was to ambitous for me. So finding quant probably would be that happy medium. So this will be my roadmap im currating from information I find online. I will try my best to stay on track, while also updating my notes and roadmap with checkboxes to get stuff done.

## Roadmap

### Software Engineering

```
Knowing how to break down a problem in large scale projects in crucial for quant developers. By honing skills in designing projects, breaking the problem down, and working with other developers is a big skill to perfect.

Learning databases is just as important as the programming language you have learned. Without databases, all information that would be gathered would be hard to find correlations with. By understanding these concepts it will boost your interview knowledge for any question to be thrown at you.
